# DailyRoutine
Initial working version of the CLI-based daily routine generator.

Takes wake-up time, work hours, and break duration as input,
and outputs a simple timeline using string manipulation and control flow.

Will expand later to include:
- time rollover support
- optional lunch breaks
- saving routines to file
- using Date objects for accurate time math
